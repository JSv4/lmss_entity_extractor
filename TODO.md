# SALI-E: Legal Matter Specification Standard Entity Recognizer

## Project Overview

SALI-E is an open-source software project that applies the Legal Matter Standards Specification ontology (LMSS) in OWL format to text documents. The project uses Python, FastAPI, HTML, and JavaScript, leveraging open-source libraries and models.

5. **API Development (FastAPI)**

   - Set up FastAPI application structure in `main.py`
   - Implemented CORS middleware for frontend integration
   - Implemented LMSS Ontology Management Endpoints
   - Implemented Document Processing Endpoints
   - Implemented LMSS Class Selection Endpoints

   - Created "Legal Matter Specification Standard" header
   - Added LMSS status indicators and "Download / Update" button
   - Implemented LMSS Statistics section
   - Created text input area and file upload functionality for document processing
   - Developed LMSS Class selection interface with "Select All" and "Clear All" buttons
   - Implemented results table for classification output
   - Added "Download JSON" button for classification results
   - Implemented "Key Word Search" and class filter in the Explorer section

7. **Docker Integration**

   - Created Dockerfile for containerized deployment
   - Implemented docker-compose.yml for easy setup and deployment

8. **Testing**
   - Developed initial test suite for ontology parsing and consistency checking

### Partially Implemented
